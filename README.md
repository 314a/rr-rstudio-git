# Introduction how to use git with R and RStudio

This tutorial in the context of the **Reproducible Research Workshop** provides you with the first steps on how to use git with R and RStudio.

The repository provides you with a step by step tutorial, that you are reading right now and is at the same time the repository you _play_ with to create your first git project in R.

## Motivation

R in combination with the distributed version control system _Git_ provides a convenient setup to make your research project reproducible. Git allows you to track and share your code and analysis. 

Some reasons to use version control are:

* It makes sharing of your projects _easy_ (once it's setup, you'll get there)
* It facilitates collaboration. People can contribute to your project and vis-versa. Also you can report errors (bugs) or suggest new additions (features).
* You can revert back to a previous version, if you find errors or accidently deleted something.
* You can _see_ what changes between different version of your code, analysis or written text!
* In R it makes sharing of your packages easy. And you can install development packages of others with two lines of code. `install.packages("devtools"); devtools::install_github("username/packagename")` (Development of R packages is more advanced in R, but is a well structured well to keep your projects tidy see: [R Packages by Hadley Wickahm](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/))

[Github](https://github.com/) is a user-friendly webservice that allows you to store your project repository remotely. Alternatives are [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

RStudio integrates support for git and svn, hence we are going to use the widely used combination _R + Git + RStudio_.

## Installation

To get started you need the following software installed on your computer:

**Git**  

* [Git](https://git-scm.com) ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)). 
* Optional Git clients: [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)(use with care).

**R + RStudio**: If your are new to R you additionally have to install R and RStudio. Check if your current R + RStudio installation is up to date.

* [R](https://www.r-project.org) ([Download R](https://cloud.r-project.org))
* [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com) ([Download RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop))

**GitHub**: On [Github](https://github.com/) create yourself a free GitHub account.

## Setup Git in RStudio

* Open RStudio and go to _Tools > Global Options..._ click on _Git/SVN_
* Check _Enable version control interface for RStudio projects_
* Set the path to the Git executable, that you just installed.

## Some other stuff
Commands to change repository "destination"

show current remote repository
> git remote -v show

remove the remote "origin" repository (origin is rather a convention than a command)
> git remote rm origin

add new repository 
> git remote add origin https://github.com/314a/rr-rstudio-git-mine.git
> git push -u origin master

now you can commit/push/pull your own project..!!

but:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10298291/cannot-push-to-github-keeps-saying-need-merge

use:
> git push -f origin master
> git push -u origin master

then push/pull should not be greyed out on rstudio again..
